            <h2>Mardi Gras' Origins</h2>
            <div class="paragraph">
                <p>The origins of Mardi Gras can be traced to medieval Europe, passing through Rome and Venice in the
                    17th
                    and 18th centuries to the French House of the Bourbons. From here, the traditional revelry of "Boeuf
                    Gras," or fatted calf, followed France to her colonies. On March 2, 1699, French-Canadian explorer
                    Jean
                    Baptiste Le Moyne Sieur de Bienville arrived at a plot
                    of ground 60 miles directly south of New Orleans, and named it "Pointe du Mardi Gras" when his men
                    realized it was the eve of the festive holiday. Bienville also established "Fort Louis de la
                    Louisiane"
                    (which is now Mobile) in 1702. In 1703, the tiny settlement of Fort Louis de la Mobile celebrated
                    America's very first Mardi Gras.

            <h2>Traditions</h2>
            <div class="paragraph">
                <p>Mardi Gras is about music, parades, picnics, floats and excitement. It's one big holiday in New
                    Orleans!
                    Revelers know to wear costumes or at least dress in purple, green, and gold, and adorn themselves
                    with
                    long beads caught from the floats of previous parades. You'll see a lot of crazy costumes, kids with
                    their families are everywhere, and both locals and visitors having a great time. Parade goers will
                    sit
                    on the ground, throw balls, play music, eat great food and watch the crowds walk by between parades.
                    On
                    Mardi Gras day, the majority of non-essential businesses are shut down because of the celebration.
                    Experienced revelers know to bring a large bag with them so they can haul away all the beads and
                    trinkets they will catch from the parades! Every year, we get a lot of questions about how it all
                    begin,
                    and how the traditions have changed.

            <h2>Mardi Gras Indians History</h2>
            <div class="paragraph">
                <p>Mardi Gras is full of secrets, and the Mardi Gras Indians are as much a part of that secrecy as any
                    other
                    carnival organization. Their parade dates, times and routes are never published in advance, although
                    they do tend to gather in the same areas every year. The Mardi Gras Indians are comprised, in large
                    part, of the African-American communities of New
                    Orleans's inner city. While these Indians have paraded for well over a century, their parade is
                    perhaps
                    the least recognized Mardi Gras tradition. "Mardi Gras Indians--the parade most white people don't
                    see.
                    The ceremonial procession is loose, the
                    parade is not scheduled for a particular time or route...that is up to the Big Chief." - Larry
                    Bannock

            <h2>King Cakes</h2>
            <div class="paragraph">
                <p>Mardi Gras and king cakes go hand in hand – especially in New Orleans where hundreds of thousands of
                    king
                    cakes are enjoyed at parties, offices and in homes every year. According to the Christian faith,
                    Jesus
                    first showed himself to the three wise men and to the world on
                    January 6th, also known as Twelfth Night or the Epiphany. The word "Epiphany” is from the Greek word
                    "to
                    show.” This is the day Mardi Gras season – hence king cake season – begins. Each king cake has a
                    tiny
                    baby inside (generally plastic now, but it's possible the baby might be made
                    of porcelain or even gold). In the past, you might have found an item such as a coin, bean, pecan or
                    pea
                    in a king cake. The lucky person who receives the slice of cake with the baby has the next king cake
                    party (or brings the next cake for the office). The king cake tradition is believed to have been
                    brought
                    over from France in the 1870s. Originally, king
                    cakes were a simple ring of dough with a small amount of decoration. After the rich dough is braided
                    and
                    baked, the top of the cake is covered with delicious sugar toppings in the traditional Mardi Gras
                    colors
                    of purple, green and gold (purple for "justice," green for "faith" and gold for "power"). In more
                    recent
                    years, many bakeries have been creative, topping their cakes with different flavors of cream cheese
                    and
                    fruit fillings and offering them in various shapes. King cakes are often served at New Orleans
                    weddings
                    as the groom's cake.

            <h2>LaToya Cantrell</h2>
            <div class="paragraph">
                <img src="images/latoyaCantrell.jpg" alt="LaToya Cantrell">
                <p>LaToya Cantrell (née Wilder; born April 3, 1972) is an American politician serving as the Mayor of
                    New
                    Orleans, Louisiana since May 7, 2018. A Democrat, Cantrell is the first woman to hold the office.
                    Before
                    becoming mayor, Cantrell represented District B on the New Orleans City Council from 2012–2018.
                    Cantrell
                    was inaugurated as mayor on May 7, 2018, the first woman to hold the position in the city's history.
                    Once in office, she established a new Office of Youth and Families, with the goal of creating a
                    strategic plan to address families in crisis in the city. Cantrell also founded a Gun Violence
                    Reduction
                    Council, tasked with finding solutions to violent crime.Starting with a push to rededicate hotel
                    taxes collected within the city for city use, Cantrell has focused on her #fairshare initiative to
                    improve city infrastructure, public transportation, public parks, and green spaces. As part of that
                    initiative, in October 2018 the City of New Orleans filed a lawsuit against four opioid
                    manufacturers
                    and distributors. During the 2019 session of the Louisiana Legislature, Cantrell negotiated the Fair
                    Share Agreement with
                    Governor John Bel Edwards and city, state, and tourism officials. The agreement secured $50 million
                    in
                    upfront funding for the city's infrastructure needs as well as $26 million in annual recurring
                    revenue
                    for the city. Following the approval of the Fair Share Agreement, New Orleans voters approved 3 of
                    the 4 proposals Mayor Cantrell and the City Council put on the ballot in the 2019 general election.
                    Voters approved a $500 million bond sale and a tax on short-term rental properties, as well the
                    establishment of a Human Right Commission under the New Orleans Home Rule Charter.
